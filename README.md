gyroscope with arduino 101


Requirements

Arduino 101
3pcs LEDS
3pcs resistor of 220 ohms
Bread Board
4pcs jumper wires


Lets build our circuit!

Connect Arduino 101 pin GND (ground) to one of the bread board pins. I picked the upper left pin.
Connect 3 resistor on the same column of the GND jumper wire
Add 3 LEDs each negative pin is connected to the other end of its resistor
Grab 3 jumper wire
Connect 1st LED's positive pin to Digita Pin ~9
Connect 2nd LED's positive pin to Digita Pin ~6
Connect 3d LED's positive pin to Digita Pin ~5
